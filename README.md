# Steam Games Dashboard & Data Analysis

This repository contains a data cleaning workflow implemented in Python and an interactive Power BI dashboard designed to analyze the Steam Games dataset sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fronkongames/steam-games-dataset/data).

---

## Dataset

- **Source:** [Steam Games Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fronkongames/steam-games-dataset/data)
- **Description:** Metadata for over 70,000 Steam games, including titles, publishers, release dates, genres, tags, pricing, reviews, supported platforms, ownership estimates, and more.
- **Period Covered:** 2013 â€“ 2025

---

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Data cleaning, preprocessing, and analysis
  - **Pandas:** Data manipulation and wrangling
  - **NumPy:** Numerical computations
  - **Matplotlib**/**Seaborn:** Data visualization during EDA
  - **Jupyter Notebook:** Interactive scripting environment
- **Power BI:** Dashboard creation and interactive analytics
- **CSV:** Data exchange format between workflow stages
- **Kaggle:** Data source and initial exploration environment

## Project Overview

This project focuses on:

- Cleaning and preprocessing raw Steam game data using Python.
- Engineering relevant features for analysis.
- Creating an interactive Power BI dashboard to explore trends and insights.
- Extracting actionable information relevant to the Steam gaming ecosystem.

---

## Data Cleaning and Preparation

Data preparation was conducted in a Jupyter notebook with the following key steps:

- Removal of duplicate entries and handling of missing values.
- Standardization and normalization of genre, tag, and category fields.
- Conversion and parsing of release dates and price columns.
- Encoding of platform support (Windows, Mac, Linux) as binary indicators.
- Export of the cleaned dataset in CSV format for use in the Power BI dashboard.

## Dashboard Overview

The Power BI dashboard presents interactive views and breakdowns of:

- Game releases by year
- Genre, tag, and category distributions
- Leading publishers and their title counts
- Platform support across Windows, Mac, and Linux
- Pricing trends and review patterns
- Ownership and concurrent player estimates

---

## Dashboard Summary

- **Total Games Analyzed:** ~71,000  
- **Average Price:** $8.08  
- **Average Owners per Game:** 85,000  
- **Top Genre (by count):** Indie  
- **Top Owned Game:** Dota 2

**Note:** Although *Counter-Strike: Global Offensive* (now *Counter-Strike 2*) is one of the most played and owned games on Steam, it was officially listed on the platform in **2012**. Since the dataset primarily covers games released **from 2013 onward**, Counter-Strike is not included in the analysis. If it were, it would likely top the ownership leaderboard by a significant margin.
